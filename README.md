# Towards Post-Quantum Security for Cyber-Physical Systems: Integrating PQC into Industrial M2M Communication

This is the accompanying code for the paper [Towards Post-Quantum Security for Cyber-Physical Systems: Integrating PQC into Industrial M2M Communication](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1322).

In our extended version, we provide a symbolic proof of confidentiality and authentication properties for quantum-resistant OPC UA variants. Our security analysis is based on the renowned formal verification tool [ProVerif](https://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/bblanche/proverif/) and the recently introduced protocol verifier [Verifpal](https://verifpal.com/).
The provided models allow the users to reproduce and extend the results reported in our work. Please cite the above paper when reporting, reproducing or extending the results.

## Purpose of the project

This software is a research prototype, solely developed for and published as part of the publication cited above. It will neither be
maintained nor monitored in any way.

## Requirements

* ProVerif (2.02pl1 or above)
* Verifpal (0.21.4 or above)
